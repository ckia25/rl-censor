- Use a target/learning networks
- Add a payload field: (-) forbidden_word, (+) other_word
- The random episilon_greedy_experience approach may not help with the updating of the parameters
- Add noise sometime not all the time
- split ip address into four chunks


- reset_environment needs to be changed

- store the sequence that lead to the reward in the priority buffer

add: add ttl, 



Train critic more than actor
